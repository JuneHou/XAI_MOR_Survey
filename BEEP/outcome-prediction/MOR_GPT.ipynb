       "\n",
       "3. Cardiac Issues: The patient&#x27;s chief complaint is exertional angina, a symptom of coronary artery disease, and the stress test showed a large reversible lateral wall defect.

       "2. Chronic Conditions: If the patient&#x27;s chronic conditions such as Diabetes Mellitus, Anxiety, Depression, Arthritis, Hyperthyroidism, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome were poorly managed or more severe, this could increase the risk of complications during and after surgery, potentially leading to a higher risk of mortality.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Cardiac Health: If the patient&#x27;s cardiac issues were more severe, such as if the angina was not just exertional but also occurred at rest (unstable angina), or if the reversible lateral wall defect seen on the stress test was larger or accompanied by other significant cardiac abnormalities, this could increase the risk of mortality.</span></div></div></pre></div>\n",

He was brought to an OSH. There, he was reportedly alert and oriented when he presented. His blood pressure was 217/89 on arrival at 3:44pm. He was able to tell his neighbor that he fell when he was just about to start cooking (and, in fact, he was found with a burner on). He was taken for head CT, which showed a large intraparenchymal bleed with biventricular extension. While returning from the CT, he had interval worsening of mental status and stopped speaking. He was intubated, despite what appears to be fairly clear notes documenting that he was DNR in accordance with prior wishes expressed to his family. He was loaded with dilantin (and given etomidate and succ for the intubation). He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation. He was seen by neurosurgery, who did not feel he was a surgical candidate. His son, living in [**Name (NI) 6257**], was called and expressed that the patient would have wished to be made comfortable, but that he would preferably be kept alive until the son was able to come from [**Name (NI) 6257**].\n",

A CT showed a R BG bleed with ventricular extension to the forth. Her labs there were remarkable for platelets of 235. The INR was pending at the time of transfer. Per the [**Location (un) **] records, the patient had a right dilated pupil and left sluggish pupil prior to transport. During transport her pupils were reportedly both fixed and dilated.  Since arrival here, her pupils have remained dilated and unreactive. She has not breathed over the vent. A 40 second pause off ventilation was tried to evaluate if the patient was able to breath over the vent. She has had no spontaneous breaths. A repeat CT here showed a stable bleed from her prior image. She was given 50gm of mannitol and neurosurgery was consulted. Given her poor exam, there was concern regarding placement of a ventriculostomy. The family is currently en route to discuss the goals of care.\n",
